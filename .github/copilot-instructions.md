Please don't make mmodifications to this machine unless totally necessary to run the programs in this repository. This is my daily driver and I don't want to accidentally brick it.

Don't create markdown documentation files - if you need to explain something to me, just do it using the chat.

Don't use any arguments in python files, if something needs to be specified then it can be done in the config file.

Don't use any emojis in the code, and if there are any, remove them.

Don't add comments explaining changes you made - comments should serve to explain the code, not your thought process.
